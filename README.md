These files provide raw data and script for replicating the results associated with the submitted manuscript "High elevation adaptation and gestational hypoxia jointly shape vascular development in a rodent placenta" by K. Wilsterman et al.

The Rscript (MFBS_analysis.R) processes and analyses three data sets that describe (a) the size of the labyrinth zone and organization of the large fetal vasculature in the placenta (LargeBloodSpacesQuant.csv), (b) the proportional make-up of the labyrinth zone microvasculature (Microvasculature_StereologyQuant.csv), and (c) individual blood spaces within the microvasculature of the labyrinth zone (Microvasculature_IndivSpaces.csv).

Metadata for all files is provided in the metadata.csv file, which includes column descriptions.
